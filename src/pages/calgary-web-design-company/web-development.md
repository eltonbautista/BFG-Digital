# FAQ SECTION
accordionQuestions: [{
  question: "Do you use WordPress or any other website builders?",
  answer: "Unless specifically requested by the client, we do not build any of our websites using WordPress, or any other website builders. We are proud to say that each and every single one of our projects are built by our expert developers using up to date and state of the art technologies - this is how we set ourselves apart from the competition."
}, {
  question: "What is the difference between a website built on WordPress or other website builders vs. your developed websites?",
  answer: "One of the biggest reasons web design companies use a website builder is because of how quick it is to create a website from it - which is a great option if you were building a website by yourself. Website builders suffer from limited capabilities, performance issues, potential security vulnerabilities, and limited personalizations. Websites developed with us have higher capabilities, increased performance, less security vulnerabilities, and are fully customizable and personalized. All of this for the same or lesser price compared to our competition."
}, {
  question: "Do I have to be in Calgary to work with you?",
  answer: "You can be anywhere in the world! We work with clients on a global basis and have the ability to communicate with you either through email, or scheduled online meetings."
}, {
  question: "How long will it take you to complete my website?",
  answer: "We focus on one client at a time and through this decision we are able to complete our projects rather quickly. Our standard timeline is 1 - 6 weeks and is highly dependent on many factors such as: size of the project, revisions, communication time, etc. "
}, {
  question: "Will I be able to maintain my website on my own when it's finished?",
  answer: "Of course! You will have full autonomy to update your website's text, pictures, products and pricing can all be easily changed on your own. However, if you are seeking to add any more complex changes such as functionalities, design, and/or structural changes, we recommend you do so with a professional developer's assistance. "
}, {
  question: "Will you maintain our website for us?",
  answer: "One of the benefits of choosing us to build your website is the fact that we will impart you with the knowledge to update minor changes on your website such as text, pictures, products, and pricing. If you require any assistance for more complicated developments such as design or structural changes, you can contact us about your requirements and we can provide an hourly quote based on your request."
}, {
  question: "Is Search Engine Optimization (SEO) included in my website build?",
  answer: "No, the build of your website will not include monthly SEO. All of the content such as text, photos, and video added to your website are seen by Google, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you will rank #1. For every single website on the internet, SEO is a constantly ongoing process and requires time and research. We do provide an SEO Boost (one time fee) which is included in the Fervent & Greatness packages. If you'd like to include our SEO Boost in your Beginnings package, it will cost an extra $500. Additionally, we can provide ongoing SEO support at a fixed monthly fee - contact us for more information!"
}, {
  question: "Who writes the text/content for my website?",
  answer: "We believe that you are the expert of your own business and understand it way better than we do, and so we will be requiring you to provide us all of the text content for your website. If you require assistance from us, please reach out and we can discuss the best solution possible. "
